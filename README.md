# How to Run the Project on Your Machine ðŸ’»:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaabrielLogan/cypress-cucumber.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
Execute the following command to install dependencies, including Cypress:
```bash
npm install cypress
```
This will download Node.js and the necessary dependencies for Cypress.

### 3. Project Overview:

The project aims to perform tests on the "Seu Barriga" application using Cypress, a front-end testing tool. The testing approach follows the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodology with Gherkin language, utilizing Cucumber.

Gherkin is a behavior description language understandable by both developers and non-developers. It allows expressing test logic in an easy-to-understand format, promoting collaboration among different stakeholders.

In this context, Cypress is used to automate and execute tests written in Gherkin. This provides an effective approach to validate the behavior of the "Seu Barriga" application in an automated and reproducible manner.

## Environment Setup

This project uses Cypress for testing and includes an example file called `cypress.example.json` with fictional or missing configurations. This file serves as a reference for necessary configurations and does not contain confidential information.

Before running the project on your machine, create a file named `cypress.env.json` following the same format as `cypress.example.json` but with real and sensitive values filled in. This `cypress.env.json` file is required for the correct execution of the project and should contain specific environment information, such as API keys, passwords, emails, etc.

Make sure never to add or share the `cypress.env.json` file in the repository, keeping it out of version control to protect your credentials and sensitive information.

      - **loginInvalid.steps.js**: File containing steps for invalid login scenarios.
    - **register/**
      - **register.steps.js**: File containing registration test steps.

- **cypress/support/**
  - May include utilities or support functions for tests.

- **cypress/fixtures/**
  - Contains example data or mocks for tests.

- **node_modules/**
  - Contains project dependencies generated by Node.js.

Your documentation is already quite comprehensive! If you wish, you can add a section on how to run the tests and also information about useful commands to facilitate project execution. Here's an example:

## Running Tests

To run all tests, use the following command in the command line:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will initiate test execution using Cypress. Ensure that the environment is correctly set up, including filling in the `cypress.env.json` file as per the earlier instructions.

To run tests specifically for tablets, you can use the following commands:

```bash
npm run cy:open:tablet
```

This will open the Cypress interface, allowing you to manually execute tests and visualize interactions in tablet mode.

And to run tablet tests in headless mode with output reporting, you can use:

```bash
npm run test:tablet
```

This command runs tests in headless mode (without a graphical interface) and generates reports using Mochawesome.

## Useful Commands

**Open Cypress for Manual Execution:**
  ```bash
  npx cypress open
  ```
  This opens the Cypress interface, allowing you to execute tests manually and view interactions.

**Run Tests with Output Report:**
  ```bash
  npx cypress run --reporter mochawesome
  ```
  This command runs tests in headless mode and generates reports using Mochawesome.
